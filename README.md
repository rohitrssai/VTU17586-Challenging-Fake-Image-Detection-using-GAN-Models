# VTU17586-Challenging-Fake-Image-Detection-using-GAN-Models
Deep Fakes are synthetic videos generated by swapping a face of an original image with the face of somebody else. we describe our work to develop general, deep learning-based models . We propose a novel framework for using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based models, we call MRI-GAN, that utilizes differences in images .
